# UnityDocFX

DocFx template with a 1:1 official Unity Documentation style

Based in UnityFX https://github.com/code-beans/UnityFX

> This is a dump of the style used for Stream Deck Integration documentation. Is not meant (yet) to be used anywhere else as-is, as it uses specific assets and hardcoded text.
